</picture> Problem Statement :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> To India For the growth of the economy, the social order, and the creation of jobs, the agriculture sector is absolutely essential. Nearly 48% of the people in India relies on the agriculture sector for their livelihood. According to the 2019–2020 Economic Survey, the median income for Indian farmers is Rs. 2500 across 16 states. The majority of Indians rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Villagers in India have the option to work in agriculture, which helps the country develop economically and on a huge scale. The issue of planting the wrong crop on their property based on a conventional or non-scientific approach affects the majority of farmers. For a country like India, where agriculture provides food for roughly 42% of the population, this is a difficult undertaking.</li>
